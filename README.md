# fast.ai course notes

## lesson 1

start with [lesson 1](https://course.fast.ai/lessons/lesson1.html)

create [crestle](https://www.crestle.ai) account. this gives you a gpu enabled jupyter environment (in the cloud)

alternatively use [paperspace]() takes somewhat longer to setup but the video claims that you get more compute for the buck.

to get some initial money, go and read this [forum thread](https://forums.fast.ai/t/paperspace-referral-link/9323). 
then click on gradient offering which provides a gradient-0 plan for $0/m

1. select "01. Base Container Paperspace + Fast.AI 0.7.x"
2. choose "Quadro P4000" machine (.52$/h)
3. click "Create Notebook" (or click twice if you get some error message)
